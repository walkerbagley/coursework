For problem 3, I created 7 different functions analyzing the Notre Dame football data in various ways. I generated a menu list and used a switch case to filter the program based on a user-entered choice. The user has a quit option, and the program will continue to run until the user enters a valid number. My options were years with a winning record, years with >=n wins, years with >=n losses, undefeated years, win rate between two specific years, wins and losses between two specific years, and average number of wins per season between two specific years. The user selects one of these options and then an according function is called to complete each task. I used all void functions because handling arrays for years was easier to do within functions rather than using pointers in main and returning arrays from the functions. I verified that the program was accurate by manually completing calculations I tested with the code as well as checking edge cases for certain functions.
